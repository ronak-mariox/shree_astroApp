/**
 * Push notifications over FCM — the only file that touches Firebase.
 *
 * The server already writes every notification to the feed and sends it to
 * whatever devices the account has on file (backend/services/notification
 * .service.js); what was missing is the device. `enablePush` asks for
 * permission, gets this install's FCM token and files it under the signed-in
 * account (`registerDevice` in services/api.ts); `disablePush` takes it back
 * on sign-out. In between, the three ways a push can reach the app are handed
 * to whoever enabled it:
 *
 *   app open        → `onForeground({ title, body, data })` — FCM draws nothing itself here
 *   app in the tray → the system draws it; a tap comes back as `onOpen(data)`
 *   app not running → the same, picked up once at the next `enablePush`
 *
 * `data` is what the server attached, every value a string: `notificationId`,
 * `type` (the notification type), and `action` — a JSON string such as
 * `{"screen":"wallets"}` or `{"screen":"consultation","id":"…"}`, or "" when
 * the notification has none. `pushActionOf` reads it, and
 * services/notificationRoutes.ts decides where each one leads.
 *
 * `@react-native-firebase/messaging` is loaded on first use rather than at
 * startup, the way services/voiceCall.ts loads Agora: a binary built before
 * the module was linked, or the iOS build (which has no GoogleService-Info.plist
 * or APNs set up yet), has no Firebase to talk to, and must come out of this as "no push" rather
 * than as an app that does not open. Nothing here throws, for the same reason
 * — push is never worth failing a sign-in or a sign-out over.
