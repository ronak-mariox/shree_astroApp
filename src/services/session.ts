 * navigation shell (whether to show the app or the welcome screen), and the
 * login screens (what to do once a code checks out).
 *
 * The tokens live in the device keystore (see secureStore.ts). They are also
 * mirrored in memory, so the request interceptor can read the access token
 * synchronously on every call rather than awaiting a keystore round-trip per
