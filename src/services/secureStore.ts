/**
 * The device keystore — where secrets go instead of into app storage.
 *
 * Auth tokens are bearer credentials: whoever holds one *is* the user until it
 * expires. AsyncStorage would keep them in a plain SQLite file that any process
 * with the app's uid can read, and that a rooted or jailbroken device hands
 * over wholesale. This puts them somewhere the OS defends instead:
 *
 *   iOS      the Keychain, encrypted by a key held in the Secure Enclave.
 *   Android  the Keystore — AES-GCM with a key generated inside hardware-backed
 *            storage where the device has it, and which never leaves.
 *
 * `AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY` is the accessibility that fits an auth
 * token. "After first unlock" so a token can still be refreshed while the phone
 * sits locked in a pocket; "this device only" so it is excluded from iCloud and
 * from encrypted backups, and a restored backup cannot resurrect a session onto
 * a different handset.
 *
 * `AES_GCM_NO_AUTH` on Android is the deliberate choice not to demand a
 * fingerprint on every read. Staying signed in between launches is the point;
 * prompting for biometrics to read the token would defeat it. Biometric
 * gating belongs on a specific action — a withdrawal — not on the session.

 * half of it — the app has to be rebuilt (`pod install` then a fresh

 * below would throw on `undefined`, and a login screen would fail for a reason
 * that has nothing to do with logging in.
 *
